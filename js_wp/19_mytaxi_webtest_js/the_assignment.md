#mytaxi JavaScript app
Please finish these tasks and send us the code as a '.zip' file afterwards. Keep the following in mind while implementing the given tasks: 

* The task is chosen to be simple enough to be finished within a maximum of four hours. Although the goal is to give you the chance to give us an impression of your coding style, coding skills and architectural knowledge. We do not only want to have the tasks solved, but solved in a beautiful way. 
* Do it as you would do it in a real world project! Keep the app maintainable and extendable.
* Please send us the result as a zip-file to the following two email-addresses: career@mytaxi.com and f.myrau@mytaxi.com
* Good Luck!

Please install all dependencies by running `npm install` and `bower install`.

To start a web server, run `gulp`.

Open `http://localhost:8080/`.

###Task 1: Retrieving Data & List
Write an JavaScript app that displays a list of vehicles. The vehicles will be loaded from an external API.

> Background: The JSON data from the Server is a snapshot of the currently available car2go vehicles in Hamburg. In a real world application this data would change frequently (~ 30 seconds).

The response from the API is in JSON and can be found in the file api/car2go/vehicles.json.

Fill the List with some useful vehicle-information provided by the API. You can create a custom cell with specific vehicle data - simply impress us ;-)

Hint: You can use third party libraries, but please document where you got your results from.

###Task 2: Map
Extend your app, that it is able to show the vehicles from the list within a map.
